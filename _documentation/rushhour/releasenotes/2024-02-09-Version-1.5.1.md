## About Rush Hour

Rush Hour is an AI-powered toolkit for animating vehicles. Using the real-time physics engine of Unreal Engine, an AI driver will pilot a physically simulated vehicle across a spline-based path. You can select a number of different profiles (Racer, Frantic, Slowpoke, etc) and a profile strength to influence how the AI will behave.

## Version 1.5.1 (2024/02/13) notes

This is a small hotfix that fixes an issue that accidentally broke previously imported cars. No need to reimport cars imported in 1.4, just update to 1.5.1.

## Version 1.5.0 (2024/02/09) notes

This update adds experimental support for Trucks and Trailers. Unreal Engine 5.1 is the minimum supported version.

### NOTE: Older vehicles need a file replacement

Older vehicles accidentally broke in this release. To avoid reimporting please follow the steps in Known Issues below.

### NOTE: Blender Addon Update Required

This version of Rush Hour requires a new version of the blender Rush Hour Vehicle Toolkit addon. Existing prepped vehicles are fine, they just need a fresh export.
