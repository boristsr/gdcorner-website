I do my best to respect the privacy of all visitors to my webpage. While I don't directly store cookies or gather personal information, I do use 2 services which may gather a little bit of information.

## Plausible Analytics

I use plausible analytics for understanding how my site is used, and how to improve it. This service doesn't use cookies, and anonymises data about visitors. You can read more about Plausible Analytics information gather here: [https://plausible.io/data-policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy)

## Commento

Commento is a service I use to handle comments. I chose this over others due to it's ability to make anonymous comments, and it's privacy policy. You can read about this here: [https://commento.io/legal](https://commento.io/legal)

Please note if you login to Commento, it will store a cookie for authentication on future visits.
