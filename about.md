Hi, I'm Philip Edwards. I live in Sydney, Australia.

In my professional life I've been a software developer and software development manager in games, and 3D/AR/VR for marketing. My interests and experience are pretty wide including games, 3D rendering, AR, VR, build systems (including CI/CD), system automation, networking and system admin.
