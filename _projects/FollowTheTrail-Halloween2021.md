I got bored on Halloween and decided to see how far I could get making a game in a few hours. Ended up spending 12 hours total, 6 hours on halloween, and 6 hours the next day and ended up with a surprisingly good result.

## Updates

### V1.01

 - Made escape button exit the game
 - Brightened experience slightly so it isn't quite so dark on other screens
