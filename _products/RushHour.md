Rush Hour is a new way to quickly animate cars and other road vehicles in Unreal Engine 4 & 5.

It's a little like instructing a stunt driver to perform in your scene. An AI will pilot your vehicle around your course. The AI driver supports several driving profiles, such as frantic, racer, precision, and slowpoke. 

You can refine the animation in several ways. You can choose a profile strength, such as making it more or less frantic. You can set a speed at each waypoint and add an action (stop, stop and wait, continue). Other hints will be coming in the future, like tap handbrake.

Rush Hour dramatically speeds up the time it takes to create vehicle animations in Unreal. It eliminates the painful and slow back and forth. You can animate entirely within Unreal. There's no need to export your environment to another tool, create your animation, and finally bring that back.

Rush Hour creates incredibly realistic driving behavior. The driving profiles are heavily tuned to create a natural look. Attempting to drive the vehicle yourself with a gamepad produces twitchy and unrealistic driving. A single mistake can mean having to repeat the drive over and over again, which is incredibly time-consuming. Rush Hour improves both of these aspects.

The driving is very consistent, so repeated runs are very similar. However, you can record a sequence to guarantee deterministic behavior animation and add the ability to scrub through a timeline.
